<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

During the internship at Sweco Bergen, I was tasked to look into a simple way to restyle the ArcGIS online homepage. I did some research into the possibilities and came across a very useful blogpost on [GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/blogs/baldy/2017/07/24/beautify-that-homepage-creating-a-unique-look-and-feel). The customized files that are given in this post are the basis on with I build the first version of the homepage. These files can be found in the [src](https://github.com/Jeroenimo95/Jeroenimo95.github.io/tree/master/ArcGIS%20Homepage/src) folder.

_**I encourage everyone to read [this](https://community.esri.com/blogs/baldy/2017/07/24/beautify-that-homepage-creating-a-unique-look-and-feel) before making any changes to the homepage**_.

ArcGIS online homepage is by default just about functional, but that's it. The homepage needs to be useful for yourself, your users and new visitors. If this is the case the default homepage could be a little confusing for some. This custom layout contributes to those how need more than the default homepage.

Here's why:

-   Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
-   Your users should be helped by useful links and buttons to quickly access features on the ArcGIS online platform
-   You should be proud of you organizations' homepage

Of course, no one template will serve all homepages since your needs may be different. But this template would be a good starting point from which you can build your own beautiful homepage.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
