<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://swecono.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)
[Live Demo](https://github.com/Jeroenimo95/ArcGIS-Homepage/blob/master/example/index.html)


ArcGIS online homepage is by default just about functional, but that's it. The homepage needs to be useful for yourself, your users and new visitors. If this is the case the default homepage could be a little confusing for some. This custom layout contributes to those how need more than the default homepage.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* Your users should be helped by useful links and buttons to quickly access features on the ArcGIS online platform
* You should be proud of you organizations' homepage

Of course, no one template will serve all homepages since your needs may be different. But this template would be a good starting point from which you can build your own beautiful homepage.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
