## About The Project

[![ArcGIS homepage Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://swecono.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)
[Live Demo](https://jeroenimo95.github.io/ArcGIS%20Homepage/example/index.html)

ArcGIS online homepage is by default just about functional, but that's it. The homepage needs to be useful for yourself, your users and new visitors. If this is the case the default homepage could be a little confusing for some. This custom layout contributes to those how need more than the default homepage.

Here's why:

-   Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
-   Your users should be helped by useful links and buttons to quickly access features on the ArcGIS online platform
-   You should be proud of you organizations' homepage

Of course, no one template will serve all homepages since your needs may be different. But this template would be a good starting point from which you can build your own beautiful homepage.

During the internship at Sweco Bergen, I was tasked to look into a simple way to restyle the ArcGIS online homepage. I did some research into the possibilities and came across a very useful blogpost on [GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/blogs/baldy/2017/07/24/beautify-that-homepage-creating-a-unique-look-and-feel). The customized files that are given in this post are the basis on which I build the first version of the homepage. The final customized files can be found in the [src](https://github.com/Jeroenimo95/Jeroenimo95.github.io/tree/master/ArcGIS%20Homepage/src) folder.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Usage

There are three important parts of the default ArcGIS online homepage. As in the blogpost, these can also be found in the Sweco ArcGIS online page. 1 is the header, 2 is the content slider and 3 is the organizations description.

![sections-screenshot][sections-screenshot]

#### Change Logo

In the code of the [Banner.html](https://github.com/Jeroenimo95/Jeroenimo95.github.io/tree/master/ArcGIS%20Homepage/src) file, the last two elements you will see in the _style_ section are the #topBanner and #resback. For both of these, you can see that we are simply applying a background image to the DIV and then placing the element. #topBanner is placing the header banner image and #resBack is placing the background image at a fixed position.  

1. Make sure new logo image follows the give size restrictions and storage location
2. Upload the image to a folder and share it with the [_Homepage_](http://swecono.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=c40bf2722c1549739f684c611d93a341#overview) Group
2. Make new logo image public, and copy the url at the bottom of the overview page of the logo
![sections-screenshot][share-screenshot]
3. Go to _Organization_, to _Setting_, to _Home Page_ and click the <> icon in the toolbar of the banner section
![banner-screenshot][banner-screenshot]
4. place image url in the 'background' declaration in the _#topBanner_ section
```css
#topBanner {
  background: url(http://);
  border-radius: 0px 0px 10px 10px;
  width: 960px;
  height: 120px;
  repeat: false;
  margin-top: 40px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-bottom: -20px;
  -moz-border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
  -o-border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
}
```
5. Save the changes made to the Banner

#### Change Background images

For the background, there are already four different default Sweco background in the banner html file. To change the background, follow the following steps:

1. add `//` to current `background-image`
2. remove `//` from the desired `background-image`
```css
#resetBack {
  position: fixed;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  min-width: 100%;
  min-height: 100%;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  z-index: -100;
  //background-image: url(http://); /* city background */
  background-image: url(http://); /* 3D bridge background */
  //background-image: url(http://); /* highway bridge background */
  //background-image: url(http://); /* map background */
  background-size: cover;
  z-index: 0-100;
}
```
3. Save the changes made to the Background

#### Change / Add Buttons

In future updates, the purpose of the buttons might change. Keep the [size and proportion limitaztions](#prerequisites) of the button images in mind when making changes.

1. Make sure new button image follows the size restrictions and storage location
2. Work with the [html file](https://github.com/Jeroenimo95/Jeroenimo95.github.io/tree/master/ArcGIS%20Homepage/src/OrganizationDescription.html) instead of changing values in the ArcGIS settings editor, which doesn't maintain the markup when saved
3. Upload or update a image on ArcGIS online, share it with the [_Homepage_](http://swecono.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=c40bf2722c1549739f684c611d93a341#overview) Group Group, copy share link and (re)place it in a (new) <img src="http://> link.
```html
<!-- 	This section holds the links to Sweco Norge AS specific content on sweco.no
      <a href=></a>	places a link to the desired ArcGIS content webpage
      <img src=/>	Displays the image desired for the link just defined
